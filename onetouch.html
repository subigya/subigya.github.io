                      <h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl">Background</h2>

                        <p class="mb-4">In January 2007, Apple unveiled the first iPhone — a product that fundamentally changed how we interacted with technology. By June, it was available for purchase. Using it for the first time felt like witnessing the future. It was a paradigm shift in design, usability, and what technology could feel like.</p>
                        
                        <p class="">That fall, inspired by the iPhone, I developed a concept for my product design class — a device focused solely on financial interactions.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-bold">The Device: &ldquo;One Touch Systems&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="mb-4">The idea was to create a <span class="font-bold">dedicated &ldquo;wallet&rdquo; device</span> built for banking and payments. Unlike a phone, this product was singularly focused on secure financial management.</p>
                        <p class="">Key Features (2007 Concept)</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Dedicated SIM card</span> for mobile internet (GPRS at the time)</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Fingerprint reader</span> for secure ID verification</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">RFID read/write capabilities</span> for contactless payments</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Local data encryption</span> for secure financial storage</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mb-10">The device&rsquo;s primary purpose was to <span class="font-bold">enable users to manage their money</span> securely on the go, without relying on a computer or visiting a bank.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl">Core Functions</h2>
                        <p>The Flash-based interface (developed in 2007) included five main modules:</p>
                        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Wallet</span> &ndash; Select and manage multiple debit/credit cards; set default payment methods.</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Records</span> &ndash; View transaction history by account or card.</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Statements</span> &ndash; Access official statements or downloadable summaries.</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Transfer</span> &ndash; Move money between accounts or make payments.</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Setup</span> &ndash; Activate, remove, or modify accounts and ownership details.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="mb-10">Much of the original prototype was built in Flash,  and SketchUp for 3D rendering of the device and Adobe After Effects for demo video <span class="italic text-zinc-400">(which I have unfortunately lost)</span>. My focus was on learning new tools and visualizing future interactions with digital finance.</p>

                        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Reflection</h2>
                        <p class="mb-4">Looking back, <span class="font-bold">One Touch Systems</span> was ahead of its time conceptually, but limited by available technology and my early UX understanding.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Years later, Apple introduced <span class="font-bold">Touch ID</span>, <span class="font-bold">Apple Pay</span>, and <span class="font-bold">NFC-based Wallet</span>, all of which closely mirrored parts of my 2007 concept — but realized through software rather than dedicated hardware.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">At the time, I envisioned the experience as <span class="font-bold">device-based</span>, because I didn&rsquo;t think such functionality could exist purely in software. Nonetheless, the idea caught some early attention — I even received outreach from an Apple recruiter. Though it didn&rsquo;t lead to an opportunity, it validated the forward-thinking nature of the project.</p>
                        
                      <div class="mt-10 mb-18 relative">
                          <img src="assets/onetouch/apple-recruiter.png" alt="Message from Apple Recruiter" class="border rounded-sm border-neutral-200"/>
                          <span class="absolute block -bottom-8 left-0 text-xs p-1 rounded-sm bg-neutral-900/75 text-neutral-200">Recruiter email from Nov 16, 2007</span>
                      </div>


                        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">The Present (2025)</h2>
                        <p class="mb-4">Today, the landscape has completely evolved. <span class="font-bold">Software has replaced hardware</span> as the driving force of financial innovation. Smartphones now include biometric authentication, NFC, and high-speed connectivity — eliminating the need for specialized hardware.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Open Banking standards and APIs (e.g., <span class="font-bold">Plaid</span>, <span class="font-bold">Yodlee</span>) have enabled secure connections between apps and financial institutions. Modern fintech products like <span class="font-bold">Monarch Money</span>, <span class="font-bold">Empower Personal Dashboard</span>, <span class="font-bold">Rocket Money</span>, and <span class="font-bold">Quicken Simplifi</span> now provide comprehensive financial visibility and management across multiple platforms.</p>
                        <p class="mb-10">Peer-to-peer payment systems such as <span class="font-bold">Zelle, Cash App, and Venmo</span> have also made money transfer seamless and secure.</p>

                        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">The Future of FinTech</h2>
                        <p class="mb-4">The next phase of FinTech will likely merge <span class="font-bold">AI-driven personalization, unified account visibility, and contextual automation</span> — helping users not only manage money, but make smarter, more predictive financial decisions.</p>
                        <p class="mb-10">The original vision of <span class="font-bold">One Touch Systems</span> — a single, secure interface for all financial interactions — is closer than ever, just realized through software ecosystems rather than standalone devices.</p>


                        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Key Learnings & Growth as a Designer</h2>
                        <p class="">This project was a foundational moment in my growth as a UX and product designer.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Systems Thinking:</span> It taught me to look beyond visual design and think in ecosystems — hardware, software, and user context working together.</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Empathy & Focus:</span> I learned that good design starts with a clear user purpose, not just technology novelty.</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Adaptability:</span> Working with emerging tools (SketchUp, Flash, ActionScript) reinforced the importance of learning fast to bring ideas to life.</li>
                          <li><span class="font-bold">Vision & Validation:</span> Seeing similar ideas realized years later validated that forward-thinking matters — but timing, execution, and user context matter more.</li>
                        </ul>
                        

                        <p class="mb-4">That experience still shapes how I approach design today — balancing bold vision with practical UX strategy, and always anchoring innovation in real human value.</p>
