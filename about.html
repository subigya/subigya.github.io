                  <article>
                    <p class="mb-4">I am a partner/co-founder at Ensue LLC and work in the capacity of UX
                      and UI Lead.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">I have worked at GE Healthcare as a UX and UI consultant, now, for over 11 years.
                      During this time, I co-designed the mission control/command center for physical spaces and web
                      from inception to commercial production. Today it is deployed in more than 300 hospitals across
                      the world. I&rsquo;m particularly happy with the unique and cohesive visual system we have built,
                      developed and implemented for the Command Center that is instantly recognizable.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">For Industrial Smart&rsquo;s EarthScout line of IoT products, I directed and led
                      design, front-end and mobile dev teams to compile user flows, wireframes, mockups, interactive
                      prototypes and collaborated across engineering, management and development teams to deliver
                      end-to-end solutions as a platform for web and native-mobile iOS and Android.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Before Ensue, I spent a couple of years working at UTHealth McGovern Medical
                      School&rsquo;s web team as lead. While I was there, we redesigned our websites across the board
                      for web and mobile while also migrating everything towards a CMS based system for the first time.
                      In addition to the medical school and departments, we also re-designed and launched the clinical
                      practice wing of the
                      medical school - UTPhysicians.com for web and mobile.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">As a problem solver, I am driven by the potential and real impact and application of
                      the products and solutions I work on. Quite recently, I engaged in some consulting work with UL
                      Solutions - and it was a challenging experience in an entirely new industry and domain I was never
                      exposed to before. I am
                      always excited about diving into new industries as it helps me bring fresh perspective to my work
                      and exposes me to unique problems and challenges.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">I have experience working in both big and small teams but prefer working on smaller,
                      focused teams that move swiftly and believe in the importance of user experience and the craft of
                      design.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Over the past decade, in addition to fulfilling my day-to-day job responsibilities,
                      I have successfully established two operational units from inception in the US and Nepal
                      respectively. I have overseen recruitment, and when necessary, termination processes, managed and
                      led the US team, and coordinated the relocation of multiple physical offices. This experience has
                      been both professionally enriching and profoundly rewarding.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">I was born in the beautiful country of Nepal. I moved to the USA in 2003 and have
                      lived in Minnesota, Denver CO, Cleveland OH, Cincinnati OH, Houston TX and now in DFW TX.</p>
