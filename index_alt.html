      <h1>Hello & Namaste. I&rsquo;m Subi &mdash; a product, UX and UI designer from the Dallas/Ft. Worth Area, Texas.</h1>
    </header>
    <main class="content">
      <p>Currently, I am a partner and co-founder at <a href="#">Ensue LLC</a> and work in the capacity of UX and UI Lead.</p>
      <p>I have worked at GE Healthcare as a UX and UI consultant, now, for over 11 years. During this time, I co-designed the <a href="#">mission control/command center</a> for physical spaces and web from inception to commercial production. Today it is deployed in more than 300 hospitals across the world. I&rsquo;m particularly happy with the unique and cohesive visual system we have built, developed and implemented for the Command Center that is instantly recognizable.</p>
      <p>For Industrial Smart&rsquo;s <a href="#">EarthScout</a> line of IoT products, I directed and led design, front-end and mobile dev teams to compile user flows, wireframes, mockups, interactive prototypes and collaborated across engineering, management and development teams to deliver end-to-end solutions as a platform for web and native-mobile iOS and Android.</p>
      <p>Before Ensue, I spent a couple of years working at <a href="#">UTHealth McGovern Medical School</a>&rsquo;s web team as lead. While I was there, we redesigned our websites across the board for web and mobile while also migrating everything towards a CMS based system. In addition to the medical school and departments, we also re-designed and launched the clinical practice wing of the medical school - <a href="#">UTPhysicians.com</a> for web and mobile.</p>
      <p>As a problem solver, I am driven by the potential and real impact and application of the products and solutions we work on. I am always excited about diving into new industries as it helps me bring fresh perspective to my work and exposes me to unique problems and challenges. Quite recently, I engaged in some consulting work with UL Solutions - and it was a fun and challenging experience in an entirely new industry and domain I was never exposed to before.</p>
      <p>I have experience working in both big and small teams but prefer working on smaller, focused teams that move swiftly and believe in the importance of user experience and the craft of design.</p>
      <p>I was born and raised in the beautiful country of Nepal. I moved to the USA in 2003 and have lived in Minnesota, Colorado, Ohio and Texas.</p>
